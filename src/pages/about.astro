    <p>
      I work across discovery, definition and delivery, using structured design
      thinking to bring clarity to complex problems. My approach combines
      research, systems thinking and iteration — shaping information
      architecture, flows and interaction patterns that hold together at scale
      and stand up in real use.
    </p>

    <p>
      A background building front ends gives me a practical understanding of how
      products are made. That technical grounding informs how I design and how I
      communicate — letting me work with engineering teams with confidence, and
      bridge the gap between design intent and implementation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Alongside hands-on design work, I lead and support teams — managing
      designers, mentoring across experience levels and helping establish ways
      of working that are consistent without being rigid. I'm comfortable
      working across tech, product and senior stakeholders while keeping teams
      focused on what actually matters.
