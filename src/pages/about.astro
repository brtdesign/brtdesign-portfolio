    <p>
      I'm a designer who cares about solving meaningful problems and making
      things feel simple. I thrive in ambiguity and enjoy bringing structure to
      unclear spaces. I collaborate closely with stakeholders to understand
      business goals, and I use qualitative research to uncover the real needs
      and motivations of users.
    </p>

    <p>
      I design and prototype in whatever makes sense — generally starting on
      paper and moving to advanced-level Figma, code, or AI as the work evolves.
      Design isn't linear or one-size-fits-all, and adaptation and iteration are
      crucial parts of my process, but the foundations stay the same: <em>
        empathise, define, ideate, prototype, test, iterate.
      </em>
    </p>

    <p>
      Collaboration comes naturally. I work with engineers and product teams
      throughout — not just at handoff — and I'm as comfortable leading a team
      through complexity as I am working independently. I'm used to navigating
      competing priorities and misaligned stakeholders, making balanced
      decisions, and staying calm when deadlines get tight.
    </p>

    <p>
      My front-end background keeps my thinking grounded in what's actually
      buildable. I test usability throughout the process, validating assumptions
      early and iterating on what I learn — so problems surface before build,
      not after.
    </p>

        I'm focused on creating work that's clear, thoughtful, and genuinely
        useful. If that sounds like what you're looking for, I'd love to chat —
