      <strong>
        I’m a lead UX designer with over 20 years’ experience designing and
        building complex systems and digital products.</strong

    <p>
      I work across discovery, definition and delivery, using structured design
      thinking to bring clarity to complex problems. My approach combines
      research, systems thinking and iteration — shaping information
      architecture, flows and interaction patterns that hold together at scale
      and stand up in real use.
    </p>

    <p>
      Having extensive experience building front ends gives me a practical
      understanding of how products are made and helps me collaborate
      confidently with engineering teams. While I’m not a developer today, that
      technical grounding informs how I design and how I communicate across
      disciplines.
    </p>

    <p>
      Alongside hands-on design, I lead and support teams — managing designers,
      mentoring at different stages and helping establish thoughtful, consistent
      ways of working. I’m comfortable operating with senior stakeholders while
      keeping teams focused on meaningful, well-reasoned decisions.
