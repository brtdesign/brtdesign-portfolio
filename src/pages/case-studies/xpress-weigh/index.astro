    <h2>TL;DR</h2>
    <p>
      I led the redesign of the Consultant ecosystem within Slimming World’s
      digital transformation, grounded in long-term ethnographic research.
    </p>
    <p>
      Xpress Weigh was the first major delivery within the redesigned Consultant
      ecosystem.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Phase 1:</strong> Reduced friction in the legacy member support tool
        — &gt;90% voluntary adoption in six weeks.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Phase 2:</strong> Challenged and redefined the underlying information
        model, securing executive alignment on core priorities.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Pivot:</strong> Adapted the interaction model when group methodology
        changed, without restarting the work.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Validation</strong> & risk reduction: Stress-tested the design through
        immersive usability testing before development.

    </ul>
  </section>

  <h1 class="phase-title"><span>Phase 1</span></h1>
  <section class="card content-block">
    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Xpress Weigh&rsquo; was a legacy suite of tools used by Consultants
      to run weekly member groups. Running on Windows tablets, it supported
      enrollment, payments, weight recording and access to member data during
      live sessions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over time, technical and design debt had resulted in dense, data-heavy
      screens. There was little distinction between data needed in the moment
      and data that was simply available.
    </p>

    <p>
      Weekly groups are fast-paced and emotionally sensitive. Consultants are
      often standing, moving between members and maintaining a human connection.
      In practice, they were navigating the interface while trying to manage the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Slimming World began exploring broader digital transformation, the
      member-support experience came under scrutiny. The system worked, but it
      wasn&apos;t helping Consultants focus on the conversation in front of
      them.
    </p>

    I was asked to deliver targeted improvements within legacy constraints, with
    a focus on reducing friction during live sessions.

  <section class="card content-block">
    <h2>Approach</h2>
    <p>
      Years of embedded ethnographic exposure — participating in groups as both
      a member and assistant — gave me a grounded understanding of real-world
      use. Targeted one-to-one interviews with Consultants across experience
      levels validated and sharpened those insights.
    </p><p>
      The findings were consistent: live sessions were slowed by hunt-and-peck
      navigation, most available data went untouched, and workarounds had become
      normalised.
    </p><p>
      Collaborating with the Directors of Field and Training, I led the review
      of the interface through the lens of the live session. We examined each
      on-screen element and asked whether it actively supported the interaction
      in the room.
    </p><p>
      <!-- Where it didn’t, it was removed or repositioned. -->
      The layout was simplified, prioritising glanceability, single-click input and
      ergonomics for standing use.

      I prototyped and usability tested the changes before development, reducing
      uncertainty ahead of build.

    <p>
      Released as an optional setting (“classic” or “new”), the redesign saw
      over <strong>90% uptake</strong> within the first six weeks, enabling a smooth
      transition for Consultants. Site visit data indicated an improvement in Quality
      of Service following implementation.

    <h2>Problem</h2>
    The member-support screens returned to executive focus, this time within the wider
    transformation programme and with broader stakeholder involvement. Early in the
    process, a clear position was stated:

    <h3 style="text-align:center; margin:var(--space-8) 0;">
      &ldquo;We&apos;re not changing the group process.&rdquo;
    </h3>
    <p>
      There was appetite to modernise the platform, but the live group model
      remained central to the business. The expectation was that technology
      should support it, not redefine it.
    </p>

    <p>
      A key part of my role was clarifying what that meant in practice.
      Establishing this boundary early helped frame decisions about what
      belonged on screen during the session.

  <section class="card content-block">
    <h2>Approach</h2>

    <p>
      Working directly with board members and senior stakeholders, I defined the
      live-session experience in detail — down to information hierarchy and
      visibility guidelines.
    </p>

    <p>
      Through co-design workshops and a <a
        href="https://www.uxforthemasses.com/buy-the-feature/"
        target="_blank">“buy-your-data”</a
      >
      prioritisation exercise with senior Consultants and the company owner, we reviewed
      each data point and agreed what genuinely needed to surface during the session.
    </p>
    <p>
      Service safaris with product and engineering built a shared understanding
      of the live environment. A subsequent Six Thinking Hats session tested
      assumptions against operational and technical constraints before moving
      forward.

  <section class="card content-block">
    <h2>Outcome</h2>
    <p>Through structured critique and iteration, I defined:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A clearer on-screen information hierarchy</li>
      <li>Simplified visibility rules</li>
      <li>
        A consistent approach to prioritising data during the live session

    </ul>

    <p>
      Decisions were often revisited and refined, with trade-offs discussed in
      context rather than against fixed rules.
    </p>

    <p>
      The direction was translated into interactive Figma prototypes and
      reviewed with board members and stakeholders. Informal hallway testing
      with Consultants helped refine the approach.

    <p>
      After multiple rounds of iteration, <strong>
        the design was ready to move into simulated group testing.

      As the iterative design phase concluded, the company made a methodological
      shift. The Consultant’s role moved from structured one-to-one support to a
      more facilitative, member-led format.

      <strong>
        The earlier position — “We’re not changing the group process.” — no

    non-linear movement between members as needed, in support of the group
    conversation.

    <h2>Advanced prototyping</h2>
    <p>
      Having iterated on the index in Figma, I rebuilt the full prototype in
      Figma Make's AI-assisted code generation to better simulate a live
      application.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using prompt-driven logic and lightweight code, I generated dynamic
      datasets, introduced event-driven interactions and maintained state across
      member views. This enabled behaviour that would have been difficult to
      model using standard Figma prototyping alone.

    <h2>Simulated group testing</h2>
    <p>
      To test the design in realistic conditions and build confidence across the
      organisation, I ran immersive simulated group sessions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consultants used the prototype on tablet devices to run live support
      sessions, while colleagues from design, product, engineering and senior
      leadership role-played as members.
    </p><p>
      Testing revealed practical issues that hadn’t emerged in earlier prototype
      reviews. For example:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Heavy use of red on the index screen amplified negative signals when
        overall group progress was low
      </li>
      <li>
        On-screen keyboard input disrupted conversation flow — replacing free
        text with selectors maintained engagement
      </li><li>
        Tap targets and interaction timing needed refinement to match live
        pacing
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Following several rounds of iteration, the design was signed off and moved
      into development, de-risked through early validation and strengthened by
      direct stakeholder participation.

    <h2>Impact & reflection</h2>

    <p>
      This work formed part of a wider transformation programme and was complex
      in its own right, shaped by deep organisational investment in the group
      model and an unexpected shift in how that model was delivered.
    </p>

    <p>
      Through sustained stakeholder engagement and research validation, I
      maintained focus on prioritisation and clarity as the scope evolved.
      Decisions were revisited where needed, but always tested against how they
      would perform in the live session.
    </p>

    <p>
      The design entered development signed-off, having been stress-tested under
      realistic conditions and reviewed with Consultants and senior
      stakeholders, including the board and Managing Director. It reduced
      ambiguity ahead of build and de-risked delivery through early validation
      and structured testing.
