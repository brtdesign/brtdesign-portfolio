          <strong> The first phase</strong> focused on a rapid redesign of the existing
          screens, improving usability while working within the constraints of the
          existing technology.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>The second phase </strong>was part of a broader transformation
          of the platform, developing the same area from scratch as part of a
          redefined product ecosystem.

    <h2>Impact & reflections</h2>
    <p>
      This was a challenging project for a number of reasons, not least of which
      the emotional attachment felt at the highest levels of the business
      coupled with a change of direction mid-way through.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thgeorugh consistent stakeholder collaboration and user research, I was
      able to successfully design an early beta that played a notable part in
      <strong> qulity of service improvments</strong>, and navigate a path
      through numerous iterations, conflicting opinions and the business leads
      inherent urge to take a kitchen sink approach, to poduce a tested and
      proven design to push in to development.
