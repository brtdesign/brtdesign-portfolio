          <strong> The first phase</strong> focused on a rapid redesign of the existing

  </section>

  <h1 class="phase-title"><span>Phase 1</span></h1>
  <section class="card content-block">
    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Xpress Weigh&rsquo; is a legacy suite of tools used by Consultants
      to run weekly member groups. The software runs on Windows tablets and
      supports enrolment, payments, weight recording, and access to member data
      during live sessions.

      <p>
        Accumulated technical and design debt left the system difficult to use
        and maintain, and misaligned with the goals of group delivery. As
        Slimming World began exploring wider digital transformation, the member
        support experience came under particular scrutiny. Complex, cluttered
        screens were acting as a barrier to the essential human connection that
        is at the heart of the group.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>
          I was tasked with delivering targeted, interim usability improvements,
          with a specific focus on reducing friction and protecting the human
          connection that underpins a successful group experience.

    <em>Exisiting solution: </em>Two complex screens were a barrier to natural,
    supportive member conversations.
  </p>
  <section class="card content-block">
    <h2>Approach</h2>
    <p>
      Years of embedded <strong>ethnographic exposure</strong> — participating in
      groups as both a member and assistant — provided a grounded understanding of
      real-world use. Targeted <strong>one-to-one research interviews</strong> with
      Consultants across experience levels validated and sharpened those insights.
    </p>

    <p>
      The findings were consistent: live sessions were slowed by <strong
        >hunt-and-peck navigation</strong
      >, most available data went untouched, and <strong
        >workarounds had become normalised</strong
      >. The problem wasn’t capability — it was <strong
        >excess and friction</strong
      > in a high-tempo environment.
    </p>

    <p>
      In <strong
        >close collaboration with the Directors of Field and Training</strong
      >, I reframed the tool around <strong
        >essential actions and essential data</strong
      >. We removed peripheral information, reduced cognitive load, and designed
      for <strong>standing, in-group use</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The outcome was a streamlined interface built around <strong
        >single-click input</strong
      > and <strong>faster information retrieval</strong> — a system that supports
      Consultants in the moment, rather than competing for their attention.

      I rapidly produced, usability tested, and iterated — removing the risk of
      costly changes during development.

    <p>
      Released as an optional setting (&lsquo;classic&rsquo; or
      &lsquo;new&rsquo;), the redesign saw &gt;90% uptake within the first six
      weeks — despite a typically change-resistant audience.

    <h2>Building on success</h2>
    <p>
      As Slimming World embarked on a full digital transformation, I was tasked
      with leading the redesign of the full suite of tools used to support the
      Consulatnts across all aspects of running their business.

    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>
      The member-support screens came back into focus at executive level, with
      broader stakeholder involvement and a strong appetite for transformation.
    </p>

    <h3>“We’re not changing the group process.”</h3>
    <p>
      While there was a transformational mindset around the technology, group
      procedure was considered sacrosanct. The platform could change; the live
      group experience could not.
    </p>

    <p>
      A key part of my role was making this distinction explicit: the technology
      was subservient to the group process. Its job was to support a 50-year-old
      operating model — not compete with or redefine it.

    I mapped two years of the Consultant lifecycle as an anchor for the wider
    ecosystem redevelopment. This served multiple projects and products, and was
    helpfed to bring clarity to what belonged in group and what happened
    outside.
  </p>
  <section class="card content-block">
    <h3>Approach</h3>

    <p>
      Building on phase one, I worked directly with the board and senior
      stakeholders to define the live tool in detail — down to what appeared on
      screen and how it behaved in-session.
    </p>

    <p>
      Through structured workshops, we worked through the specifics: what stayed
      visible, what was removed, and how interactions needed to function under
      real time pressure. A buy-your-data prioritisation exercise with
      gold-standard Consultants and the company owner forced clear trade-offs
      about what genuinely enabled effective support.
    </p>

    <p>
      I organised a service safari with product and engineering colleagues to
      observe the live group environment, followed by a Six Thinking Hats
      session to interrogate assumptions and work through the implications of
      what we had seen.

    The quote became a shared shorthand across co-design sessions — referenced

    <h2>Outcomes</h2>

    <p>
      The fundamental concepts from phase one were validated, but leadership
      alignment was needed on the precise information hierarchy and how data
      should be visualised in-session.
    </p>

    <p>
      Through multiple iterations — often working around the boardroom table
      with print-outs and Sharpies — we refined and stress-tested the hierarchy
      until it held up under scrutiny.
    </p>

    <p>
      The outcome was a clearly defined on-screen structure, simplified
      visibility rules, and agreed visualisation principles, supported by
      high-fidelity designs ready for build and aligned across board, product,
      and engineering.

    <h2>Impact & reflections</h2>
    <p>
      This was a challenging project for a number of reasons, not least of which
      the emotional attachment felt at the highest levels of the business
      coupled with a change of direction mid-way through.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thgeorugh consistent stakeholder collaboration and user research, I was
      able to successfully design an early beta that played a notable part in
      <strong> qulity of service improvments</strong>, and navigate a path
      through numerous iterations, conflicting opinions and the business leads
      inherent urge to take a kitchen sink approach, to poduce a design that was
      test and proven, derisking development.
