          <strong> The first phase</strong> focused on a rapid redesign of the existing
          screens, improving usability while working within the constraints of the
          existing technology.

        <p>
          <strong>The second phase </strong>was part of a broader transformation
          of the platform, developing the same area from scratch as part of a
          redefined product ecosystem.

    <h2>'Xpress Weigh'</h2>
    <p>
      The system was designed to give consultants the tools and prompts needed
      to instigate positive behaviour change in members, supporting
      accountability, habit formation, and encourage weekly engagement.
    </p>

    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Xpress Weigh&rsquo; is a legacy suite of tools used by Consultants
      to run weekly member groups. The software runs on Windows tablets and
      supports enrolment, payments, weight recording, and access to member data
      during live sessions.

      <p>
        Accumulated technical and design debt left the system difficult to use
        and maintain, and misaligned with the goals of group delivery. As
        Slimming World began exploring wider digital transformation, the member
        support experience came under particular scrutiny.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>
          I was tasked with delivering targeted, interim usability improvements,
          with a specific focus on reducing friction and protecting the human
          connection that underpins a successful group experience.

    Consultants were required to navigate two complex tablet screens to access
    and record data whilst maintaining a natural and supportive conversation
    with each member.

    <h2>Approach</h2>
    <p>
      Building on deep knowledge gained through long-term ethnographic study —
      particpating in group as both a member and assistant over several years —
      I conducted one-to-one research interviews with Consultants across a range
      of backgrounds and experience levels to round out my understanding of the
      issues.
    </p><p>
      I worked closely with the Directors of the field and training functions,
      maintaining focus on essential data and being disciplined about removing
      periphery or 'just-in-case' information.
    </p><p>
      The design emphasised simpler interactions and ergonomics suited to the
      live, in-group context of use.

  <h2>Impact & reflections</h2>
  <p>
    This was a challenging project for a number of reasons, not least of which
    the emotional attachment felt at the highest levels of the business coupled
    with a change of direction mid-way through.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thgeorugh consistent stakeholder collaboration and user research, I was able
    to successfully design an early beta that played a notable part in
    <strong> qulity of service improvments</strong>, and navigate a path through
    numerous iterations, conflicting opinions and the business leads inherent
    urge to take a kitchen sink approach, to poduce a design that was test and
    proven, derisking development.
