    <h2>TL;DR</h2>

  </section>

  <h1 class="phase-title"><span>Phase 1</span></h1>
  <section class="card content-block">
    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Xpress Weigh&rsquo; is a legacy suite of tools used by Consultants
      to run weekly member groups. The software runs on Windows tablets and
      supports enrolment, payments, weight recording, and access to member data
      during live sessions.

      <p>
        Accumulated technical and design debt left the system difficult to use
        and maintain, and misaligned with the goals of group delivery. As
        Slimming World began exploring wider digital transformation, the member
        support experience came under particular scrutiny. Complex, cluttered
        screens were acting as a barrier to the essential human connection that
        is at the heart of the group.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>
          I was tasked with delivering targeted, interim usability improvements,
          with a specific focus on reducing friction and protecting the human
          connection that underpins a successful group experience.

    <em>Exisiting solution: </em>Two complex screens were a barrier to natural,
    supportive member conversations.
  </p>
  <section class="card content-block">
    <h2>Approach</h2>
    <p>
      Years of embedded <strong>ethnographic exposure</strong> — participating in
      groups as both a member and assistant — provided a grounded understanding of
      real-world use. Targeted <strong>one-to-one research interviews</strong> with
      Consultants across experience levels validated and sharpened those insights.
    </p>

    <p>
      The findings were consistent: live sessions were slowed by <strong
        >hunt-and-peck navigation</strong
      >, most available data went untouched, and <strong
        >workarounds had become normalised</strong
      >. The problem wasn’t capability — it was <strong
        >excess and friction</strong
      > in a high-tempo environment.
    </p>

    <p>
      In <strong
        >close collaboration with the Directors of Field and Training</strong
      >, I reframed the tool around <strong
        >essential actions and essential data</strong
      >. We removed peripheral information, reduced cognitive load, and designed
      for <strong>standing, in-group use</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The outcome was a streamlined interface built around <strong
        >single-click input</strong
      > and <strong>faster information retrieval</strong> — a system that supports
      Consultants in the moment, rather than competing for their attention.

      I rapidly produced, usability tested, and iterated — removing the risk of

      Released as an optional setting (&lsquo;classic&rsquo; or

    <p>
      The member-support screens came back into focus at executive level, with
      broader stakeholder involvement and a strong appetite for transformation.
    </p>

    <h3 style="text-align:center; margin:var(--space-8) 0;">
      “We’re not changing the group process.”
    </h3>
    <p>
      While there was a transformational mindset around the technology, group
      procedure was considered sacrosanct. The platform could change; the live
      group experience could not.
    </p>

    <p>
      An early part of my role was making this distinction clear: the technology
      was subservient to the group process. Its job was to support a 50-year-old
      operating model — not compete with or redefine it.

    I mapped two years of the Consultant lifecycle as an anchor for the wider
    ecosystem redevelopment. This served multiple projects and products, and was
    helpfed to bring clarity to what belonged in group and what happened
    outside.
  </p>
  <section class="card content-block">
    <h2>Approach</h2>

    <p>
      The user journey map created a shared view of the end-to-end process and
      became a reference point in conversations about what data truly belonged
      on screen. For example, extensive historical data, while valuable for
      context, was repositioned into preparation and reporting workflows.
    </p>

    <p>
      Working directly with the board and senior stakeholders, I defined the
      tool in detail — down to what appeared on screen and how it needed to
      perform under real-time pressure. Through workshops, co-design sessions
      and a <a
        href="https://www.uxforthemasses.com/buy-the-feature/"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener">buy-your-data prioritisation exercise</a
      > with senior consultants and the company owner, we clarified what stayed visible,
      what got cut, and made explicit trade-offs to ensure each data point earned
      its place.
    </p>

    <p>
      I also organised service safaris with product and engineering colleagues
      to build shared understanding of the live group environment. A Six
      Thinking Hats session tested the approach against operational and
      technical realities, refining it for practical use.

    <h2>A slight pivot</h2>
    <p>
      After numerous rounds of iterative design based on the established group
      model, the organisation made a methodological shift. The Consultant’s role
      moved from structured, one-to-one support, to a more facilitative
      group-led format.
    </p>

    <p>
      To understand the implications I observed the roll-out training, and
      attended a number of groups to see how the new format was landing in
      practice.
    </p>

    <p>
      The tool needed to adapt to support a different group dynamic. Rather than
      discarding the exsiting work I adpated. I introduced an index layer in
      front of the existing screens — a stripped-back overview of all members
      that supported dynamic facilitation while preserving access to depth when
      needed.

  </section>
  <section class="card content-block">
    <h2>Impact & reflections</h2>
    <p>
      This was a challenging project for a number of reasons, not least of which
      the emotional attachment felt at the highest levels of the business
      coupled with a change of direction mid-way through.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thgeorugh consistent stakeholder collaboration and user research, I was
      able to successfully design an early beta that played a notable part in
      <strong> qulity of service improvments</strong>, and navigate a path
      through numerous iterations, conflicting opinions and the business leads
      inherent urge to take a kitchen sink approach, to poduce a design that was
      test and proven, derisking development.
