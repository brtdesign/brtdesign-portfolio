      <p>
        Regular gym-goers often want to track progress consistently, but
        variations in machine callibration, setup, and personal settings — even
        on the same exercise — make like-for-like comparison unreliable. Without
        context, numbers alone don’t tell the full story.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, many existing gym trackers add friction rather than
        clarity. Basic logging is often buried inside bloated feature sets,
        making it harder to understand real progress.

        High-level flows were first mapped in Miro to validate the core logging
        and review journeys. These flows were then translated into Figma, where
        interaction details were prototyped, refined, and simplified through
        repeated passes.

        An offline-first architecture means all data lives on the device. This
        allowed me to quickly build an installable proof of concept and test it
        in real gym sessions — both personally and with a small group of
        friends. Observation and feedback from real workouts directly informed
        each iteration, keeping the work grounded in practical, in-the-moment
        use rather than theoretical scenarios.

    <p>
      <strong>
        Building on established prototyping practice, this project explored how
        tools such as ChatGPT Codex can meaningfully accelerate the path from
        idea to working product.
      </strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      Interaction design and flow definition were familiar territory, but the
      work reinforced how early design decisions directly shape code structure,
      data integrity, and long-term flexibility.
    </p>

    <p>
      The key learning was the value of treating prototypes as structural
      artefacts, not just interaction proofs. In future work, I would involve
      technical constraints earlier and use prototyping to actively de-risk
      architecture as well as UX.
    </p>

    <p>
      From a training perspective, I have found seeing the accurate context - <em
        >exactly what I did last time</em
      > - has been a spur to work a little harder.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a wider release, the focus shifts to learning from real usage and
      evolving the product through measured iteration rather than feature
      expansion.
