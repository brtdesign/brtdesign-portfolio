      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p>
        Engagement dropped off between classes, and coaches lacked visibility into how members were progressing
        outside the studio.

      <h2>Impact</h2>
      <p>
        A unified member hub increased weekly active usage by 41%, while coaches gained a shared dashboard for
        workouts, milestones, and feedback.
