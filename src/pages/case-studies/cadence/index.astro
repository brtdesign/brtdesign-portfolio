      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p>
        Regular gym-goers want to track progress consistently, but variations in
        machine setup and personal settings — even when performing the same
        exercise — make like-for-like comparison unreliable.
      </p><p>
        While the market is saturated with gym trackers and fitness loggers,
        many are expensive and bury basic exercise logging inside bloated,
        non-contextual feature sets. This makes it harder, not easier, to
        understand real progress.
      </p>
      <h3>Validation</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Input from personal trainers and regular gym users.</li>

        High-level flows were first mapped in Miro to validate the core logging
        and review journeys. These flows were then translated into Figma, where
        interaction details were prototyped, refined, and simplified through
        repeated passes.
      </p>
      <p>
        An offline-first architecture means all data lived on the device. This
        allowed me to quickly build an installable proof of concept and test it
        in real gym sessions — both personally and with a small group of
        friends. Feedback from real workouts directly informed each iteration,
        keeping the work grounded in practical, in-the-moment use rather than
        theoretical scenarios.

    <p>
      This project proved highly valuable as a self-directed exploration of
      rapid, high-fidelity prototyping. The potential to move quickly from idea
      to working product using tools such as ChatGPT Codex was particularly
      clear.
    </p><p></p> While defining user flows and refining interactions came naturally,
    mapping underlying code structures and maintaining data integrity presented a
    new and worthwhile challenge. <p>
      There are multiple directions this product could evolve in, and the next
      step is learning from a broader user base once a wider release becomes
      possible.
